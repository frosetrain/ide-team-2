Refactoring our code
Using Object-Oriented Programmingâ„¢

Attributes:
angle, straight_begin, buffer ...

The main loop will read these attributes and control the robot accordingly.

All robot-controlling code should be in the main loop and not in other functions.

Look at the code and identify all corners that are hardcoded to have different behaviour.

Use some sort of Python script to call the main function and see whether the results are the same as before.

Add good Python practices like docstrings and type hints.

Places where robot behaviour is hardcoded:

* Places where straights start
* Slow and speed areas
* Places to deposit each color

We can add different buffers depending on whether the turn is 0
